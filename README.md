# Compose Multiplatform Spin the Wheel POC

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the creation of a native "Spin the Wheel" component using Compose Multiplatform.

It is based on existing Jetpack Compose component "Spin the Wheel" [SpinWheelCompose by laurentyhuel](https://github.com/laurentyhuel/SpinWheelCompose).
The goal of this POC is to showcase how similar engaging UI components can be built once and shared across multiple platforms using Compose Multiplatform.
